Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-schools/school-of-computing">School of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>, jointly supervised by <a href="https://mark-dras.github.io/">Prof. Mark Dras</a> and <a href="https://xuqiongkai.github.io/">Dr. Qiongkai Xu</a>. My primary research interest is in tackling privacy and security challenges in ML/NLP models and their applications.

I approach these challenges from two directions:

* **Data privacy**: auditing potential leakage throughout the lifecycle of machine learning models (e.g., reconstruction attacks) and evaluating or improving defenses such as differential privacy.
* **Security**: investigating mechanisms that make models vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, particularly backdoor attacks, and developing interpretable defenses to enhance robustness and trustworthiness.

Beyond these areas, I am keen to explore advanced and emerging topics in privacy and security, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration on related challenges.

<!-- I completed a Master of Research at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a> in 2024, where I received a thesis score of 93 (High Distinction), leading to my admission into the PhD program with a full scholarship. Before that, I earned an M.S. in Information Technology with Distinction from <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> in 2023, an M.S. in Control Engineering in 2016, and a B.A. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013, both from <a href="https://www.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>. -->
