Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-schools/school-of-computing">School of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>, where I am also completing a Master of Research degree (Jan. 2024 – Jan. 2025). My primary research interest is in tackling privacy and security challenges in ML/NLP models and their applications.

I approach these challenges from two directions. On the privacy side, my work examines how sensitive data can leak at different stages of a model’s lifecycle, such as through reconstruction attacks, and how defenses like differential privacy can be audited, assessed, and improved. On the security side, I study the mechanisms that leave models vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, with a focus on backdoor attacks, and develop interpretable defenses to strengthen their robustness and trustworthiness. Beyond these areas, I am keen to explore advanced and emerging topics in privacy and security, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration on related challenges.

I received an M.S. in Information Technology with Distinction from <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> in 2023. Prior to that, I earned an M.S. in Control Engineering in 2016 and a B.A. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013, both from <a href="https://english.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>.
