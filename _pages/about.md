Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-schools/school-of-computing">School of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>, where I am also completing a Master of Research degree (Jan. 2024 â€“ Jan. 2025). My primary research interest is in tackling privacy and security challenges in ML/NLP models and their applications.

I approach these challenges from two directions:  

- **Data privacy**: auditing potential leakage throughout the lifecycle of machine learning models (e.g., reconstruction attacks) and evaluating or improving defenses such as differential privacy.  
- **Security**: investigating mechanisms that make models vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, particularly backdoor attacks, and developing interpretable defenses to enhance robustness and trustworthiness.  

Beyond these areas, I am keen to explore advanced and emerging topics in privacy and security, and I welcome opportunities for collaboration on related challenges.

I received an M.S. in Information Technology with Distinction from <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> in 2023. Prior to that, I earned an M.S. in Control Engineering in 2016 and a B.A. in Mechanical Engineering in 2013, both from <a href="https://english.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>.
