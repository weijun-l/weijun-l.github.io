Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/faculty-of-science-and-engineering/departments-and-schools/school-of-computing">School of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au/">Macquarie University</a>, where I am also completing a Master of Research degree (Jan. 2024 â€“ Jan. 2025). My primary research interest is in addressing privacy and security threats in NLP models and their applications.

I received a Master of Science (M.S.) in Information Technology with Distinction from <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">The University of Melbourne</a> in 2023. Prior to that, I earned a Master of Science (M.S.) in Control Engineering in 2016 and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Mechanical Engineering in 2013, both from <a href="https://english.cqu.edu.cn/">Chongqing University</a>.

I worked as an Automotive R&D Engineer at <a href="https://www.dongfeng-nissan.com.cn/">DongFeng Nissan Passenger Vehicle Company</a> from 2016 to 2021.
